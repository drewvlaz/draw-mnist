A demo can be found on [youtube.](https://youtu.be/jn0ooptXEls "MNIST Interactive UI with PyGame")

When getting started with machine learning, there are a lack of resources that actually make use of a visual element to aid in teaching. This model, written in python and using tensorflow, is used to power a user interface with PyGame.

    ```python
    with sess as sess:
        saver.restore(sess, "YOUR_PATH/data/convolutional.ckpt")
        main()
    ```

* Depending on your operating system, the font size may need to be adjusted.
